<h2> This is a page about what cats <em>do</em> and <em>do not</em> love </h2>
	<br>
<h1> Before we get look at what cats do not like, let's go over some things that cats love: </h1>

	<li> <b>Milk</b> </li>
		<ul> Although milk may be okay for kitties, it is not recommended for adult cats </ul>

	<li> <b>Catnip</b> </li>
		<ul> Cats love catnip because... well it makes them feel good. It is like weed for cats. catnip can make your cat feel very happy. </ul>

	<li> <b>Birds</b> </li>
		<ul> Cats are attracted to birds because much like their other feline cousins (Lions, Bobcats, Tigers, etc), they have a natural instinct to hunt prey. </ul>

	<li> <b>Toys</b> </li>
		<ul>Toys can help your cat get exercise and be an outlet for their pedatory instincts. Having toys for your cat could also relieve bordeom and reduces future health problems. </ul>

<h1> Now, let's talk about some things that cats absolutely <em>dread.</em> </h1>
	<li> <b> Too much or not enough attention </b> </li>
		<ul> Cats are quite confusing pets, but they seem to want a balance between spending time with you, and doing their own thing by themselves. </ul>

	<li> <b> Loud Noises </b> </li>
		<ul> Much like humans, cats do not like to be startled by sudden loud noises. This could cause to become distressed. </ul>

	<li> <b> Tummy Rubs </b> </li>
		<ul> Cats do not like to be rubbed on their underbellies, due ot the fact that their vital organs are located there. If your cat displays their underbelly to you, it could mean that they trust you. </ul>

	<li> <b> Being stared at for too long </b> </li>
		<ul> Although having a staring contest with your cat may seem fun, cats do not see it that way. In the wild, cats usually stare down prey before they make an attack. </ul>
